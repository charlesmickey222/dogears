## about
#### Dogears Is a web application designed for users to be able to track the books that they are reading or have completed. Users can add their books to the bank, save them to their profile, then add a dogear to them to mark their spot in the book and add any notes about where they left off. 
#### The inspiration for this app came from organizing books in real life! I have never met a more prolific reader than my older sister and when she passed my family was left with her library. On a weekend that my parents were both out of town I walked past the tupperware containers that had housed her books and decided to organize and shelf them as a surprise to my Mom. As I went through her collection, I saw all the dogeared pages and bookmarks with notes and I was able to be in touch with my sister again.
